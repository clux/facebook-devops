## Fast & secure config-managed continuous delivery for kubernetes

Over the last few years Babylon Health has grown from a tiny startup to a sizable company in charge of sensitive health care data. As such, the demands in terms of automation, security, and standardisation have grown accordingly. In this talk we explore some of the lessons learned and benefits of defining your own CI abstractions in an ever-changing kubernetes world, and how to keep continuous delivery fast, without sacrificing security.

We will introduce the abstractions we went for and our main rust tool that codifies them; shipcat. Join for tales of Kubernetes CRDs with GitOps, along with the woes of helm.
